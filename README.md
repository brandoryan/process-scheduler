# process-scheduler
This program takes a particular predetermined workload given by 'processes.txt'</br>
and defines each process scheduling algorithm's performance for that workload.</br>

It also determines which process scheduling algorithm would give the minimum average</br>
waiting time between the following process scheduling algorithms:</br>
FCFS, SJF (non-preemptive), and RR (quantum = 10 milliseconds)</br>
